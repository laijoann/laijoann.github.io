          I used to write down notes like someone's birthday or favourite colours into the notes field of my contacts app. But as the years went on, the amount of notes I was writing got longer and longer - favourite doughnut flavour, their cat's names, ideas for presents that I might get them, really funny stories that I don't want to forget. Eventually I needed a better way to organize my notes - wouldn't it be great if I could categorize my notes, have a timeline, and most importantly, be able to write my notes without fear of my data being sold or my contacts being farmed?

          Weeell, it just so happens that I am also a software developer. So I decided to make my own personal CRM - I call it Deets.

          Information Deets collect - absolutely nothing. Deets is a personal CRM that does not collect and does not store even an inch of data from you. There is no Deets server out there. Deets simply does not retain data of any sort.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Where does Deets content get stored? Every note that you write into Deets is stored in your own Notion database. Disclaimer - I'm not at all associated with Notion and I can't guarantee that they won't ever get hacked so I can't promise you 100% data security - but Deets itself is not keeping any of your data. Deets is just a clean UI to help you manage your own data. Even when you provide Deets with a Notion token, that token itself is exclusively and directly stored into your phone (which yes, does mean that when you change phones or if you delete and re-download Deets, you will need to input the token again. But I will always prioritize data privacy over convenience. The whole reason why Deets exists is because I needed a CRM and I am a firm believer in data privacy).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Why does Deets ask for permission to see the contact list? Deets needs to see the contact list so that there's something to link into each record in your Notion database. When Deets creates a new page in your Notion database, it also backlinks each Notion page into your contact list so there's an easy way to migrate to your future phone (or if you ever want to just tap that backlink and directly edit your notes on the Notion app, you can do that too!). Deets will never store your contacts.

          Please don't use Deets for nefarious reasons. And please don't steal my code and put another version of this on the app store to charge other people money with. I made Deets because I needed a personal CRM, and the only reason why it's up on the app store is because my friends keep asking me if they could use it too. I'd like to keep this free for everyone (well, except me. Apple charges me annually just to keep my Apple developer account lol. So if you'd like to buy me a tea to keep me caffeinated and happy, I would appreciate it!), and I'd like for Deets to be a safe place for myself and everyone else to write notes about a friend's favourite cakes, or a neighbour's dog's name, or that sweet story your grandma shared that you really don't want to forget.
